# Mapping_Earthquakes
In this project, we use data driven documents (d3), Javascript, HTML and bootstrap to traverse and retrieve geographical features and non-spatial attributes from  GeoJSON data. We also use Javascript's Leaflet library along with Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data from the US Geological Survey.
